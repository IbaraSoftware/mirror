## What does Mirror do?

Mirror works similarly to the popular Chrome extension, **Loom**, but without any servers that hold onto your videos. **mirror** allows you to do screen recording, annotation, and more, and saves the files right to your device locally where you can share them anywhere and with anyone you'd like.
